| February 25 | 45 Minutes in class |                                                                                                                                                                        We spent this time brainstorming our solution to the problem. By the end of the class, we landed on a tabulation soluiton using 2D dynamic programming that I think works. The solution begins with a row major traversal of a 2D array where each row / column represents a letter in one of the two input strings. Then, begin the iteration. At each vertice, take the highest of the left / upward paths (the greatest of all the paths to reach that state). If the two characters of the strings you are at match, add one and then iterate both row and column. |

I got it to work for the smallest case, but it fails in every other case. I think the issue lies in not copying over the longest path data. Essentially, when a match is hit, the code immediately iterates the column it starts at and moves on to the next row. I think the issue is that I sometimes skip over the vertices where the recent max was stored. |

After talking with my group, I have realized that I misunderstood the algorithm. For some reason, I was trying to move down and right after a match (I got there because I believed that handled moving past the two matching characters) when in reality, I should have been looking back diagonally to find the optimal solution to the sub-problem. I will fix this next session. |

I also tried worked out a lot of if statements by slightly increasing the size of the 2d array and adding a space before the two sequences. This allowed me to skip any out of bounds checks. |
| February 27 |      3:00-3:25      | I spent this time trying to really understand how the algorithm really worked. I started by adding comments and then just started brainstorming to find the underlying rule of the algorithm. I think I'm on to something. For me, it made more sense to think of it backwards. In the case where you have a match, looking back diagonally is essentially looking to the subproblem of the case where both strings don't have those characters. If you had ABCD and AQDO, when you look backwards, you are essentially saying, "now look at the case with BCD and QDO". In the other case, when you find the max of looking up or down, you are finding the maximum between the cases of removing the first letter from each of the strings. |
